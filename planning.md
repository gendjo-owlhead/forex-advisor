# Development Plan for Next Session

Here are the features we plan to implement next:

1.  **Implement Augmented Analysis Graph:**
    *   Transition the "Augmented Analysis Graph" from a placeholder to a functional component.
    *   This could involve parsing key levels (support/resistance) from the AI analysis and overlaying them on a simplified chart or directly on the TradingView widget if its API allows.

2.  **Implement Real-Time Alerts:**
    *   Develop the "Alerts" section from a placeholder into a live feed.
    *   This could involve setting up notifications for significant market events or when a price target from an AI analysis is reached.

3.  **Automated Analysis Runner:**
    *   Introduce a feature to automatically run the "Analyze" function at user-selected time intervals (e.g., every 15 minutes, 1 hour).
    *   This will keep the analysis fresh without requiring manual clicks, providing a more "live" feel to the AI signals.
